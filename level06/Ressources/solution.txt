#there is an executable and a php file
#if we execute the php file with the executable
#we get a php code and by reading it we can see
#that there is usage of regex
#after understanding regex and reading and reading code
#we assume that y variable must be a file to open and read
#and we should givethe executable the following command:
#[x ${`getflag`}]" to translate it via regex to ${`getflag`}
#and as usual we put the file with this command on /tmp
