#again there is executable and a file
#ltrace again to read the level08 program
#it takes a file as argument and we pass token to it
#we again use ltrace with token as argument
#we get a message we can't read token
#the program compares token to filename
#we use the symlink to change the filename and trick the program
#after 1000000 of failed test and almost gave up
#we used the following methond ln -s : (we use the whole path of file)
#/home/user/level08/token /tmp/ourtoken
