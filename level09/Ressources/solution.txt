#the same as level08 but this time we execute ./level09 token
#we get an output and also we can't read the level09 program
#using ltrace, it is protected so we randomly give level09
#different arguments and I noticed that the output has always
# the same lenght as the argument then I give it 123456
#and I got 13579; and I thought maybe it adds an index to ascii code of
#each caracter. After reading ascii table and comparing that to output
#I understood that teh program add to the caracter the index of the previous one
#let's write a reverse program and compile it inside of /tmp
#cd /tmp .. vim decode.c ... gcc decode.c -o lol ..
#we get back to level09 and we execute /tmp/lol 123456
#the output is 000000
#so it's correct then let's try /tmp/lol $(cat token)
